					<h1>An Ideal Candidate for Your Intern Position<br /></h1>
				</header>
				<p>Advancing into the last year of my Master's in Computer Science, specializing in Data
					Science/Engineering, I'm deeply engaged with a challenging set of courses, building on my double
					Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science.</p>

				</p>My weekly schedule truly reflects my diligence and who I am. Mornings are spent in lectures
				where I soak up knowledge on database structuring and the CAP theorem. Then, I put this knowledge
				into action by crafting SQL queries, and turning abstract theories into functional databases, guided
				by Ullman's "Complete Book of Databases."

				The afternoons are dedicated to cracking machine learning algorithms and implementing them using
				Python's libraries. No matter how tough the day has been, I make it a point to solve a problem on
				LeetCode to keep my coding skills sharp and to stay interview-ready.
				</p>
				Away from the glow of my computer screen, the football field is my playground. As a playmaker, my
				role is to strategize and support, much like how I approach collaborative projects in my studies.
				It's this intersection of strategy, creativity, and teamwork that I love bringing to every team
				effort, both on and off the field.
				</p>
				Every week, I am actively shaping my future—a future where I can take complex data and make it
				meaningful and useful.
				</p>
				As I look for an end-of-study internship, I'm eager to find a place to apply what I've learned and
				to continue my journey of never-ending learning.
				If you need someone with a solid comprehension of database theory and practical coding skills, who
				works well with others, I’d be happy to talk. You can reach out to me by <a
					href="mrassiyacine@gmail.com">@Email</a> or link up on <a
					href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yacine-mrassi-99895716a/">@linkedin</a>. I'm all
				about teaming up to face tech challenges and pushing past limits together.</p>
